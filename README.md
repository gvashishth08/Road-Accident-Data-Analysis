# Road-Accident-Data-Analysis
I developed a comprehensive project in Excel, creating dashboard and tables to analyze the data. This process involved several stages, Including data preprocessing, data cleaning , and data visualization.

- Cleaned data by removing errors in "Accident Severity" and extracted "Month" and "Year" from the date column.
- Analyzed primary KPIs, including total casualties and Percentage, severity distribution (fatal, serious, slight), and casualties by vehicle type.
- Visualized secondary KPIs, such as monthly trends of casualties for Year 2021 & 2022, road type casualties, surface condition impact, and area/time-based patterns.
- Created clear, actionable insights using pivot tables and graphs.
